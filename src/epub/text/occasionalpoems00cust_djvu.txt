EVENING 

Grey  grows  the  glimmer  of  an  April  even 
And,  as  the  sunset  glory  fades  away, 
There  comes  to  float  upon  the  clouds  to  Heaven, 
The  burden  of  the  day. 

Hushed  are  the  birds  :  save  that  their  wakeful  leader 
Begins  the  silence  silently  to  break, 
From  the  dark  shelvings  of  the  darkening  cedar 
Across  the  low-lit  lake. 

And  distant  chimes,  on  that  full  air  delaying, 
In  gentle  cadence  swell  a  softened  sigii, 
And  the  far  voices  of  the  children  playing 
Harmoniously  reply. 

And  slow  ascends  the  burden  of  creation, 
The  dimlv  dying  tract  of  western  tire, 
Songs  of  rejoicing,  tears  of  lamentation, 
A  tirmament's  desire. 

The  widow's  cry,  that  Mings  to  God  above  her 
The  words  of  promise  that  his  love  hath  given, 
And  the  lost  longings  of  a  lonely  lover 
That  scorn  the  help  of  Heaven. 

The  dumb  despairing  of  an  orphan's  sorrow, 
That  living  lays  his  life  beneath  the  sod, 
And  that  alone  which  shares  all  human  sorrow, 
A  hump^j-iust  in  God. 


So  slowly  rises  'mid   the  softened  splendour 
Of  dewborn  darkness  ominous!}-  furled, 
The  lowly  agony  of  man's  surrender, 
•  The  voices  of  the  world. 

Ah,  those  sad  longings,  never  to  be  granted! 
Bring  they  not  back  the  old   resistless  liow 
Of  those  tear-watered  memories  we  planted 
A  little  year  ago? 


But  hush!  the  gathering  shadows  now  have  banished 
The  golden  splendours  that  but  yet  we  saw: 
And,  with  the  world's  —  the  sunset  glories  vanished 
Are  found  aeain  no  more. 


Eton,   1879. 


DAUER  IN  WKCHSKL 


Lean  and  shaken  autumn  woods, 
Leafless  autumn  weather, 
Gone  the  graces,  gone  the  goods, 
Autumn  altogether. 

Idle  autumn  fallows  sigh, 
Fruitless,  dull,  apart; 
Leaden  autumn  in  the  sky. 
Autumn  in  my  heart. 

Gone  the  springtime,  gone  the  strife-time. 
Each  first  passionate  goal  : 
Utter  autumn  of  one  life-time, 
Autumn  of  a  soul. 

II 

Sudden  comes  a  shiny  June  day 
What  is  this  ?  and  where  ? 
Why  does  twilight  leap  to  noonday  ? 
Tell  me  .  .  .  ?     She  is  there. 

Back  to  summer,  back  to  spring-time, 
Back  the  white  dawn  air. 
Back  the  blamclessness  and  ring-time, 
Now  that  —  She  is  there. 

Peonies  are  pouring  purple, 
Pinks  incense  the  air, 
Roses,  lilies,  all  at  her  pull  — 
Just  because  --  She's  there. 


(J  the  gladness  !     O  the  madness  ! 

C)  the  rifled  air  ! 

Ah  .  .  .  that  sudden  shiver  of  sadness  .  .  . 

Is  she  really  there  ? 

This  pure  perfect  iris  vision, 
This  diviner  air, 
Is  it  but  the  old  derision  ,  .  .  ? 
Just  the  old  despair  .  .  . 

Autumn,  you  bedraggled  scoundrel, 
Go  away,  get  out  ! 

Else  you'  11  deep  and  deeper  down  drill 
Heart-holes  —  make  me  doubt. 


Ill 


What?    It's  Winter  come  already? 
Joy  one  bears  the  pain  of  .  .  . 
I  can  still  be  stalwart,  steady  — • 
Nothing  to  complain  of. 

Only  it  is  hard  to  bear, 
Thinking  of  the  past  of  it ; 
Hard  to  say  good-bye,  my  Dear, 
Hard  to  feel  the  last  of  it. 


If  betwixt  the  live  and  dead 
I  should  never  see  you, 
Blessings  on  your  darling  Jiead 
That  you  just  could  be  you. 


SEPARATION 

There's  thousands  of  miles  of  country, 
And  thousands  of  leagues  of  sea, 
And  m^'riad  men  and  women 
That  separate  you  and  me. 

To  each  is  the  gain  of  the  struggle, 
To  each  is  the  pain  of  the  loss, 
I'm  wondering  up  at  the  Pleiads, 
And  you  at   the  Southern  Cross. 

Tve  talked  to  you  now  for  an  hour; 
You've  listened  —  my  heart  can  tell ; 
And  I  hold  3'our  hand  for  a  moment  — 
Dear  love,  it  shall  vet  be  well. 


9 
DISTANCE 

You  pray  to-night,  I  know,  for  me, 
You  kneel  beneath  the  straining    spars, 
Between  unfathomable  sea. 
And  undiscoverable  stars. 

And  all  the  unsounded  waste  beneath, 
And  all  the  unbounded  vast  above, 
Are  lesser  wonder  than  the  breath 
That  breathed  the  pra3'er  of  such  a  love. 

And  all   the  soundless,  boundless  roll 

Of  years  that  claim  and  change  and  chain, 

Js  less  eternal  than  the  soul 

That  dares  and  bears  that  sacred  pain.

AN  C)BS1:RVATI0N 

You  would  not  know  the  brown  thatch   now, 
So  gre\-  the  years  have  gro\\  n  it: 

Your  love  liad  kept  it  bright  enow, 
If  only  you  had  shown  it. 

You   would  not  know  the   blue  e}es  now, 
So  dim  the  tears  have  made  them  : 

They  well  had  danced  and  glanced,  1  trow, 
If  but  vour  love  had  bade  them. 


You  would  not  know  the  sad  heart  now. 
That  leapt  so  at  yonr  greeting  ; 

Yet  you  have  listened  long  ago, 
And  blessed  it  for  its  beating. 

You  would  not  know  the  hard  mouth  now. 
Nor  words  that  wander  from  it,  or 

The  warm  close  kiss  you  used  to  miss, 
So  low  is  mv  thermometer. 


You  would  not  know  the  forehead  now, 
Nor  all  that  homed  within  it ;  • 

Only  a  kinkled,  wrinkled  brow, 

Though  your  least  word  would  win  it. 

Your  voice  still  wins  to  all  it  can, 

Vour  sweet  smile  softens  some  eye  ; 

You  and  the  others   took  a  man, 
And  made  a  mlzzv  mummy. 


II 
NKARER,  MY  GOD 

"Nearer,  my  God,  to  Thee."  you  sang  to-day; 
The  great  dome  trembled  to  your  passionate  breath; 
Happ}-  —  who  seek' St  not  but  to  find  a  way 
Nearer  to  Death. 

"Nearer,  my  God,  to  Thee"  — but  there  are  some 
Who  one  discomforting  watch  of  life  must  keep, 
Whose  only  dream  is  wake,  and  once  to  be 
Nearer  to  Sleep. 

"Nearer,  mv  Go  J,   to  Thee  "  -  vet  there  were  davs 
Love  turned  glad  eyes  around,  and  not  above, 
And  sold  my  soul  to  win  my  dear  love's  praise, 
Nearer  to  Love. 

"Nearer,  my  God,  to  Thee;"  bow  down  to  me, 
Me,  who  such  waste  and  wandering  ways  have  trod. 
Love,  lead  me  also  at  the  last  to  be 
Nearer  to  God. 


A  LITTLE  MONTH 

While  through  dead  woods  dead  tires  of  Autumn  creep, 

And  tiowers  are  fallen,   and   bh'ds  have  ceased  to  sing, 

A  fair  first  blossom  in  his  May  of  Spring 

Fell  on  the  Winter  of  Eternal  Sleep. 

Live  Springs  sow  seeds,  but  dying  Autumns  reap 
Harvest  :  and  misery-memory  thoughts  that  cling 

Closer  than  motherhood,  at  the  last  shall   bring 

Harvest  of  heart  in  heaven  to  those  that  woep. 

Only  the  watch  and  wail  are  weary-long, 

And  sad  eves  see  not  what  glad  eyes  have  seen,  • 

And  dead  is  dead,  and  what  is  dead  is  dear. 

Lift  up  thy  heart,  let  dear  love  right  the  wrong  , 

Turning  the  thought  of  things  that  might  have  been 

Tender,  by  thinking  of  the  things  that  were. 


ON  THE  DRAWING  OF  A  CHILD  IN  HOSPITAL 

Over  this  little  head 

Dark  wings  are  beating  ; 
About  this  little  bed 

Life  and  Death  meeting'. 

Sudden  in  dusk  of  death 

And  strangled  choke  of  pain, 

The  bright  death  quiveis, 

Touches  the  springs  of  breath, 

And,   where  graves  gloomed   beneath, 

Young  life  Hows  back  again 

in  sunn\    rivers. 


H 
SURGE 

Flickering  shadow  cast  b\-  the  crest  of  a  surging  billow. 
Flinging  from  its  forehead,  Hying  from  the  foam  ; 
Keeping  live  its  utmost,  trusting  to  its  pillow, 
Curls  the  thunder  over,  drowns  it  far  froni  home. 

Flickering  lovelight  cast  into  e3'es  by  the  eyes  believed  in, 
Flashing  to  the  forehead,  Hying  in  the  breath  ; 
Lightning  gashing  scar  by  a  soul  that  a  soul's  deceived  in 
Surge  of  drowning  sorrow,  yearning  it  were  death. 


WARTE  NUR,   BALDE 

Calamity  hath  brought  mc    ver}-  low, 
Dressed  me  in  desolation,  hate  and  scorn; 

The  lilies  dear  life  grew 

Stink  in  a  putrid  stew. 
Vet  wait  I,   looking  through  the  long  night's  woe, 

For  one  day's  dawn. 

The  righteous  round  their  e\-es  and  mouths  aghast: 
White  sepulchres  tlush  ros}-  red  with  scorn  ; 

Each  burgess  of  Cjomorrah 

Lifts  holy  hands  of  horror  ; 
r  11  v/atch  their  faces  when  the  dark  is  past, 

On  that  dav'  s  daw  n. 

In  the  last  darkness  of  the  long  black  hours, 
The  oath  of  patience  yet  all  unforsworn, 

The  face  I   love  will  come, 

The  voice  no  more  be  dumb, 
The  thorn-crown  blow  a  coronet  of  Howers, 

Aud  that  day  dawn.

TO  A  PORTRAIT 

Beautiful  Face  ! 

Is  your  licart  broken  that  }ou  look  so  sad  ? 

Is  thei^e   no  heart  of  earth   that  once  made  glad 

Your  heart,  to  hearten  \et  your  flower  of  grace  ? 

Is  God  uniender  toward  \'0u  ?   Or  can  Man, 

Loving  such  dear  eyes. 

Or,  save  despairing 

For  too  jnuch  caring, 

Grudge  his   uucrow  nedness  in  the   race  he  ran, 

And   squandered   life  and   loved  and   lost  the   prize? 

They  pay  the  worthiest  cost, 

\\  hose  lives  for  vou  were  lost. 


I? 

THE  EIGHTH  POINT 

O  Little  face  of  heaven, 

O  Little  heart  of  hell, 
If  all  love's  sins  were  seven, 

You've  made  me  sin  them  well: 

Sin  well  and  sulFer  greatl}^, 

And  still  to  grace  my  state, 

You've  scored  3^our  eighth  point  latel}^, 
And  taught  me  how  to  hate. 


i8 
AMICTUS  AMORIS 

About  the  perfect  body  of  my  love 

A  vesture  clings,  whercfrom  no  force  may  free  her  ; 
Tho'  she  stood  naked  to  the  stars  above, 

Even  so  you  should  not  see  her. 

The  invisible  fragrance  breathing  round  the  rose,  — 

The  infrangible  warmth  that  will  not  leave  the  tire, 

The  losing  that  to  loving  elings  so  close  — 
So  clings  my  love's  attire. 

It  covers  every  precious  part  of  her, 

It  holds  her  dear  dark  hair  within  its  hood  : 
Her  eyes  look  thro'  it  :  with  it  where'  er  she  stir 

Her  little  feet  are  shod. 

She  may  not  set  it  otY  for  any  stress, 

Nor  night  nor  day  ;  yet  naught  of  earth  may  soil 
The  first  fair  freshness  of  that  angel-dress. 

Nor  tears,  nor  time,  nor  toil. 

No  holy  priest  absolving  for  his  Lord, 

No  mightiest  monarch  to  his  tlu-one  ascending, 
No  martyr  maiden,  kneeling  to  the  sword, 

Wears  so  divine  a  lending. 

Yet  all  that  radiant  raiment  of  my  love. 

No  questing  sight,  nor  touch,  shall  e'et  discover; 
For  warp  and  woof,   the  wet)  is  woven  of 

The  kisses  of  her  lover, 


i9 
NON  NOBIS,  DOMINE. 

Not  unto  us,  O  Lord, 

Not  unto  us  the  rapture  of  the  da}', 

TJie  peace  of  night,  or  love's  divine  surprise, 

High  heart,  high  speech,  high  deeds,  'mid  honouring  eyes 

F^or  at  Thy  word 

All  these  are  taken  away. 

Not  unto  us,  O  Lord  ; 

To  us  Thou  givest  the  scorn,  the  scourge,  the  scar, 

The  ache  of  life,  the  loneliness  of  Death, 

The  insufferable  sutticiency  of  breath. 

And  with  thy  sword 

Thou  piercest  very  far. 

Not  unto  us,  0  Lord  ; 

Nay,   Lord,   but  unto  her  be  all  things  given. 

My  light,  and  life,  and  earth,  and  sky  be  blasted. 

But  let  not  all  that  wealth  of  lovj-be  w'asted  ;  /^r^p, 

Let  Hell  alTord 

The  pavement  of  her  Heaven.

Ps.  OVI.   15. 

'  Tis  well,  'tis  well,  in  the  lowest  hell, 

And  I  laugh  at  the  lick  of  tlic  tire  ; 
The  tlame  roars  up  in  its  brimstone  cup, 

And  it  //res  what  lies  on  the  pyre. 
They've  done  their  worst  for  the  man  they  cursed^ 

They'  ve  made  damnation  dire  ; 
But  they  can't  undo  the  joy  I  knew 
When  I  knew  mv  Heart's  Desire. 

There's  one  will  scream,  and  one  blaspheme, 

As  thev  writhe  in  the  molten  mire, 
And  curse  the  earth  tliat  gave  theni  birth. 

And  damn  their  dam  and  their  sire. 
It  pleases  the  devils  to  watch  their  revels, 

But  1  wake  tho  devils  to  ire, 
^^'hen  I  burst  into  rhyme  at  the  thought  of  the  time 

AVhen  I  found  uiy  Heart's  Desire. 

They  wrench  my  back  on  a  red-hot  rack,- 

Thev  comb  mv  nerves  with  wire, 
Tliey  poison  with  pain  the  blood  of  my  brain. 

Till  the  devils  of  devilry  tire; 
They  spit  from  above  on  the  name  of  my  Love  ; 

Thev  call   mv  Love  a  liar, 
But  they  can't  take  away  the  dream  of  the  day, 

Wlien  I  won  my  Heart's  Desire. 


21 

So  here  in  hell   it  is  all   very  well, 

And  I'm   snug  as  a  beast  in  a  byre; 
'I'he  devils  are   beat   by  the  thought  of  my   Sweet, 

And   I  don't  propose  to  retire. 
And  blood  scalds  skin  where  the  tiame   bites  in, 

But   I   like  the   w  armih  of  the   lire  ; 
For  ir  burns  me  throuj^h   with  tlie  lieat  I   knew 

When   I  lield  my  Heart's  Desire. 

O   Heart's  Desire,   who  art  not  by  my  side. 
Whose  Love,  so  sweetly  lived,   so  strangely  died, 
Tliro'  faltering,  falseness,  failure,  and  the  lire. 
Be  still   for  ever  all   my  Heart's  Desire.

THE  IMMORTAL  END 

Not  in  the   upland  lawns  ol   mind, 

Not  bv  the  Svrian  stream, 
But  in  low  trodden   tracks  we  find 

The  vision  and   the  gleam. 

Thuujjh  rock-o'erhung  and   burden-bowed 
Man  sees  in  faint  and   fasting, 

Blue  sky  is  more  than   all   the  cloud 
And  very  much  more  Jasting. 

It  matters  not  what  life  we   spend, 

What  anguish  we  inspire, 
So  tlicre  be  (me  immortal  end 

To  one  immense  desire. 

So  that,  without  one  finest  Heck, 
Thro'  lire  and  wiath  and  rods, 

Incense  not  insult  shall   bedeck 
The  lalseness  of  our  gods. 


25 
THE  DARK 

When  \vc  are  locked  in  stones  away, 
^\■ith  all   death's  dark  between, 

Will   that  wliicli  then   they'  H   call  our  clay 
Think  of  what  niii^ht  have  been  ? 

What  shall  1   meet  at  spirits'  tryst, 
\\'hat  will   the  moonlight  bring? 

A  shining  shape  of  amethyst, 
Or  just  an  ugly  Thing  ?  - 

Down  in  the  darkness  shall   \^  c  dream, 
Or  will  even  dreams  be  done, 

Of  love,  and  passion,  and  the  gleam 
Of  what  was  once  our  sun  ? 

A  sun  whose  shining  never  failed. 
Whose  light  was  never  dim, 

But  only  seemed  at  seasons  veiled, 
Because  we  clouded  him. 

Then  once  be  wake,  aod  clutch  the  dark^ 
And  fight  the  choking  breath. 

"  O  Christ  !  why  did  I  ?  "    Then  a  spark 
Of  blinding  thought  —  and  death.

A  FRAGMENT 

1  have  a  little  white  thiiiir  wonderful 

Untamed   unchained  as  sea  or  sky  .   .    . 

But  the  sun  and  the  salt  of  both  tiding  the  river, 

Both  arrow  liglit,  amazing  and  radiant, 

So  that  thouglit,   sun  and  tiesh  are  only  oue, 

That  one  which  keeps  creation  in  its  hands 

And  makes  life  beautiful  and  clean  and  whole.  .  •

LIFE'S  SONG       .     . 

Ah,    Life,   is  this  'Fhy  song  : 
Endure  and  die  .  .  .  ? 

Still   strive   with  pain  and  wrong 

As  trne  hearts  strove  ; 

Till  Love  and  Truth  and  Pureness,  which  are  strong, 

Death's  self  disprove. 

Ah   Life,  Thy  crowning  song 

is  crow  nini"    Love.

may  be,  though  the  World  knows  it  not,  that  thev-  have  seen  what 
manv  prophets  and  kings  have  desired  to  see  and  have  not  seen  it: 
that  thev  have  followed  the^gleam:  and  that  their  eyes  have  seen  in 
every  wave  of  wind  upon  the  wheat  the  trailing  of  the  skirts  of  those 
whose  faces  see  GOD  ,   ,  , 


Every  where  and  every  day  there  will  be  amongst  the  living  the 
others  of  their  generation  —  a  feljriwship  of  presences,  some  dim,  some 
shining,  but  presences  never  to  be  wholly  put  away  --  plucking  at 
their  hearts,  flooding  sometimes  their  memories,  seeming  sometimes  to 
touch  their  hands,  masterful  sometimes  to  govern  and  to  save  their 
souls.  There  will  be  a  sort  of  national  Golden  Treasury,  sacred  and 
serene,  in  to  which  men  and  women  will  enter  at  their  need  to  tind 
new   faith,   new  courage,    and  unfathomed   inexhausted  consolation.... 

(H.  C.   I916)
