Where can you reap so white a harvest as in this wan troop
of men: lives divinely appointed with hearts to feel, with brains to
conceive, with hands to execute, who perish broken, desolate⁠ ⁠… It
may be, though the World knows it not, that they have seen what
many prophets and kings have desired to see and have not seen it;
that they have followed the gleam: and that their eyes have seen in
every wave of wind upon the wheat the trailing of the skirts of those
whose faces see GOD⁠ ⁠… 			</p>

Every where and every day there will be amongst the living the
others of their generation⁠—a fellowship of presences, some dim, some
shining, but presences never to be wholly put away - plucking at
their hearts, flooding sometimes their memories, seeming sometimes to
touch their hands, masterful sometimes to govern and to save their
souls. There will be a sort of national Golden Treasury, sacred and
serene, in to which men and women will enter at their need to find
new faith, new courage, and unfathomed inexhausted consolation⁠ ⁠… 			</p>

(H. C. 1916)
